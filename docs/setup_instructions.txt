Windows Speech-to-Text App Setup Instructions
==============================================

Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.8 or higher installed
2. uv package manager (install from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
3. OpenAI API key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Installation Steps:
1. Clone or download the project files

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   uv sync

   Note: If pyaudio installation fails on Windows, you may need to install it separately:
   uv add --dev pipwin
   uv run pipwin install pyaudio

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Edit .env and replace "your_openai_api_key_here" with your actual API key:
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

4. Run the application:
   uv run python speech_to_text_app.py

Usage:
1. The app will automatically load your API key from the .env file
2. Check that the API status shows "✓ API Key loaded from .env"
3. Click "Start Recording" and speak into your microphone
4. Click "Stop Recording" when finished speaking
5. The transcribed text will appear in the text area
6. Use "Clear Text" to clear the display
7. Use "Save Text" to save transcription to a file

Project Structure:
- speech_to_text_app.py - Main application
- pyproject.toml - Project configuration and dependencies
- .env - Your API key (keep this file private!)
- .env.example - Template for environment variables
- .gitignore - Excludes sensitive files from git

Features:
- Automatic API key loading from .env file
- Real-time microphone recording
- OpenAI Whisper API integration for accurate transcription
- Simple, user-friendly GUI
- Text saving functionality

Troubleshooting:
- If API status shows "✗ No API key found", check your .env file
- If you get audio device errors, check your microphone permissions
- Make sure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Ensure your internet connection is stable for API calls
- For dependency issues, try: uv sync --reinstall
